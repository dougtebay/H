# Harmony

Harmony is an app for tracking your medications. It can help you remember what you're taking when or look up something you took in the past. The app will also automatically alert you to interactions between drugs, using data from the National Institutes of Health.

Try Harmony on Heroku [here](http://harmony-web-app.herokuapp.com/).

Harmony was created by Doug Tebay, Leon Harary, Erik Aylward, and Greg Marquet at the Flatiron School in New York City.
